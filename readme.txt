Configurator is a plugin that allows you to edit wp-config.php in the browser.

== Description ==

Configurator is a plugin that allows you to edit the `wp-config.php` file of your installation within the browser.

It lists every item in your `wp-config.php` file and displays it as a form so you can edit them as you wish. Just be wary though, making a mistake on crucial parts, such as your database user and password, can allow you to crash your WordPress installation.

If at any point your WordPress stops working after editing your `wp-config.php` through Configurator, fear not! Configurator makes sure to back up your `wp-config.php` file before overwriting it, so that in the event that anything happens, you can simple delete your `wp-config.php` file and then rename `wp-config.php.bak` to `wp-config.php`!

== Compatibility ==

Configurator is tested to work from 3.0. I am not aware of any incompatibilities so far.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin by dropping the .zip file into the `wp-content/plugins` folder or install it through your WordPress' wp-admin panel. __That's it!__
